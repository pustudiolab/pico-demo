# StudioLab Raspberry Pi Pico Soldering + Programming Demo

Welcome! This repository contains demo programs to run on the Raspberry Pi Pico. This code assumes that you are working with a Pi Pico that has been soldering onto one of the demo boards provided by the StudioLab.

To get started, follow the instructions [here](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-pico/0) to install the necessary firmware and a programming environment called Thonny. Work up through the "Blink the onboard LED" section, and ignore the instructions about a breadboard or connecting any components (your Pi Pico is already connected to a bunch of components!) Alternatively, more advanced users could follow the instructions [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/get-started-with-raspberry-pi-pico-series-and-vs-code/) to use VSCode.

Then, copy the code from this repository onto new files within Thonny or VSCode and enjoy!
